Hello! 👋  

Many people have messaged me with questions, so I decided to create a free mini-course for you. 🎉 

This information is freely available on YouTube, so I didn’t put a price on these videos. I simply structured everything in one place and recorded these materials for you. 👍  

In this bot, you’ll get 5 training videos and a glossary for each one. The only condition is to be subscribed—nothing complicated.  

I recommend going through it without delaying and getting into trading. You can see the results we achieve on the channel. If not, check out the link below.  

Good luck and enjoy watching!   

And once again—there’s nothing difficult here, you got this!

🚀 Lesson 1: How to Make Your First $1000?  

Hey again! Here’s the first video. This is more of a brief introduction where you’ll understand the direction we’re heading in and what knowledge you’ll gain from this free lesson series.  

Below, I’ve attached a glossary for those unfamiliar with the terms mentioned. Enjoy watching!  

📋 Glossary for the Lesson:  

Here are the definitions for these terms:  

🔶 Token – A cryptographic asset that represents a certain value or right within a specific ecosystem, network, or project.  

🔶 Decentralized Exchanges (DEX) – Platforms for cryptocurrency trading that operate without a central authority or intermediaries.  

🔶 Centralized Exchanges (CEX) – Cryptocurrency platforms managed by a single company or organization, which maintains centralized control over the trading process. Examples: Binance, Kraken, Coinbase.  

🔶 Verification – The process of confirming a user's identity to prevent fraud and comply with regulatory requirements, such as Anti-Money Laundering (AML) rules and Know Your Customer (KYC) policies.

📋 Glossary for the Lesson:  

Here are explanations for these terms:  

🔶 Narratives – Key stories or ideas that shape public perception and trends. Narratives can include the perceived potential value of a cryptocurrency, its use cases, or the philosophy behind the project.  

🔶 DexScreener – A data analysis tool focused on decentralized exchanges (DEX). It provides information on current prices, trading volumes, charts, and other metrics for cryptocurrencies traded on decentralized platforms like Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and others.  

🔶 Tokenomics – The concept of a token’s economy within a specific project or blockchain ecosystem. Tokenomics covers aspects such as token distribution (who gets how much), the role of tokens in the ecosystem (e.g., for voting, rewards, or access), inflation and deflation mechanisms, etc.  

🔶 Pump – A sharp increase in an asset’s price, often driven by mass interest and speculation. A pump can result from manipulations, such as coordinated actions by a group of people who buy a token, creating hype and further price growth.  

🔶 Ticker – The abbreviated name or symbol of a cryptocurrency (e.g., BTC for Bitcoin or ETH for Ethereum).  

🔶 Stop-loss – An order that automatically sells an asset if its price drops to a specified level. This is a risk management tool: a trader sets a stop-loss to limit losses in case the market moves against their position.  

🔶 Take-profit – An order that automatically sells an asset if its price reaches a predetermined profit level. This order helps lock in profits without requiring constant market monitoring.

🔶 Market Cap (Market Capitalization) – The total market value of a cryptocurrency, calculated by multiplying the current token price by the total number of tokens in circulation.  

🔶 DYOR (Do Your Own Research) – A reminder that every investor should independently research a project before investing their money.  

🔶 ATH (All-Time High) – The highest price a cryptocurrency or asset has ever reached in its history. For example, if Bitcoin once hit $69,000, that would be its ATH.
